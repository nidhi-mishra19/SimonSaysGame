# SimonSaysGame
The Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive memory-based web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to remember and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. Each correct attempt advances the player to a higher level, making the game progressively more difficult.
This project demonstrates key front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and dynamic UI updates, while providing an engaging user experience.
